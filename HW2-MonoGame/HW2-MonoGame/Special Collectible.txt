My special collectible is a collectible that moves in a particular pattern. I add values to the x and y posiitons of the rectangle to move it in a particular direction and make sure that it bounces off the edge of the screen.

They look like ordinary collecibles and are part of the collectibles list but for every new level I use one more collectible in the list as a special collectible.
